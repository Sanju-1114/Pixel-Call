##  Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
* `npm` or `yarn`

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Sanju-1114/Pixel-Call.git](https://github.com/Sanju-1114/Pixel-Call.git)
cd Pixel-Call
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the server directory:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```
*The server typically runs on port `8000`.*

### 3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal and navigate to the client directory:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run start
```

### 4. Configuration (Crucial for Mobile/LAN testing)
To allow devices on the same Wi-Fi (like your phone) to connect, you must use your computer's local IP address instead of `localhost`.

1. Find your IPv4 Address (Run `ipconfig` on Windows or `ifconfig` on Mac/Linux).
2. Open `src/environment.js` (or wherever your server URL is defined).
3. Update the URL:

```javascript
// Change http://localhost:8000 to your specific IP:
const server = "[http://192.168.1.](http://192.168.1.)X:8000"; 
export default server;
```

### 5. Run the Frontend
```bash
npm run start
```
*The application will open at `http://localhost:3000`.*
